| Item | Who | Notes |
| Announcements |     | March 29 is current transition date for n2t resolver and form processing  <br>jk: maybe we should be prepared for wrinkles in naan request processing that will temporarily delay turnaround time on requests (taking more than 2 days to complete) |
| Any news items we should blog about? Any calls for papers, submission deadlines, upcoming meetings we should note? Please add to [Calendar of events](Calendar-of-events_208341505.html). |     | review coming events on calendar  <br>everyone is invited add things to the calendar, and to indicate if they are attending<br><br>jk: submitted ARK tutorial to Core Forum 2024<br><br>bc: April 9-12 is the Archiving conference; BnF will send some people there<br><br>jk: seeing IIIF conference reminds me of training on biblissima (bnf) and how it would be great to have a feature allowing an ARK (or IIIF URL) link directly into a single page image rather than to the top-level manifest  <br>bc: I know something about those issuesw  <br>jk: would be nice to brainstorm what links could look like and best practices for ARKs in this situation  <br>ac: I'm also interested in tracking archival use of the iiif standard |
| Status of new NAAN processing developments at CDL |     | jk: asked DV for new fields |
| review of [in-progress issues](https://github.com/CDLUC3/naan_reg_priv/projects/1) |     | cp: shoulder request from Nové Steinerovo Muzeum (only received Google form; shoulder requests do not get automatically turned into github issues)  <br>jk: I know him and will respond; basic answer is we don't do experimental requests |
| Action items from last time<br><br>- [x] Sefakor Ankora will discuss with WACREN the idea of a blog post about participation on NAAN WG |     | this has been delayed<br><br>cp: have an idea for a blog post that I will be working on |
| Curator changeover as of today |     | Bertrand as primary, Sefakor as secondary<br><br>bc: old requester came back with a question that I'd originally handled (Libro Cazadores de Microbios En Venezuela); I will followup with the new question |
