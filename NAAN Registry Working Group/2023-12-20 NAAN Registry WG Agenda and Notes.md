| Announcements | All | We are sorry to see Maria Gould's departure from the group and wish her well in her new position at DataCite! She has been a huge contributor to this group and the Outreach group, especially liaising with CDL on infrastructure.<br><br>jk: In preparing the end of year wrapup message, I updated the google map, but there were 46 entries with addresses to be corrected in order to generate flags/pins. I also normalized a few names.<br><br>  <br><br>November summary : 24 completed requests, 3 (duplicates or troubleshooting) denied, 2 waiting for additional information from the requester. |     |
| Any news items we should blog about? Any calls for papers, submission deadlines, upcoming meetings we should note? Please add to [Calendar of events](Calendar-of-events_208341505.html). | All | Presentation at St-Louis<br><br>Data documentation initiative<br><br>Tutorial rejected in the Web archives conference in Paris.<br><br>New one in Prague, June 2024, [PIDfest](https://www.pidfest.org/). Organizers: Czech National Library of Technology, Australian Research Data Commons. |     |
| Handling old unanswered requests | All | TO BE UPDATED<br><br>Who / how should we handle the old requests |     |
| Unreceived messages from the Google form, related to the issue of TAB characters needing to be added to copy/pasted requests.<br><br>_Nov 4_ – BC: For an unknown reason, I have not received the mail from the Google form for Archives départementales de l'Isère (I have received the Github notification for issue [https://github.com/CDLUC3/naan\_reg\_priv/issues/279](https://github.com/CDLUC3/naan_reg_priv/issues/279) though). Have you? I can't process the request without it, as far as I know.  <br>_Nov 4_ – JK: The processing script requires TAB characters separating the request form questions from the answers. TAB characters occur in the email that Google normally returns, but unfortunately github doesn't preserve them in its messages. I also didn't receive the email from Google, which began happening for me more and more often in the past year. But I thought I was the only one not receiving it. Now it's happening to others I guess. A short term remedy is to paste in the block of questions and answers that github puts out and, for each question, to edit the text to change the space after the colon (or '?') to TAB. I don't know how to enter a TAB in a form except to copy and paste TAB characters into the (previously pasted) text. It's **tedious**.<br><br>_Dec 20_ – JK: update: I now never get email from Google with the correct TAB characters. Does anyone else? Does anyone have a workaround for the tedium? | Bertrand, John | Updated curator checklist:  [naan\_reg\_priv/curator\_check\_list.md at main · CDLUC3/naan\_reg\_priv (github.com)](https://github.com/CDLUC3/naan_reg_priv/blob/main/curator_check_list.md#quick-summary)<br><br>  <br><br>Non-reception of some Google Forms for some members:<br><br>Possible solutions or workarounds<br><br>*   Forward google forms to the affected group member when curator |     |
