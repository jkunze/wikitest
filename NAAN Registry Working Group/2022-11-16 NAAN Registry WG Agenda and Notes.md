| Item | Who | Notes |
| Announcements |     | Passed 1000 ARK organizations this month<br><br>First 3 NAAN candidates from West Africa  <br>jk: will  meet this week with UTSC library about their new ARK service (see code4lib article)<br><br>Plugin developed to assign ARK ID for OJS 3.X.X (Smarty/PHP/JavaScript) : plugin available on Github @yasielpv . Documentation isn't easily available, some exam of the package should be reviewed to provide some needed improvements. |
| Calls for papers, submission deadlines, upcoming meetings |     | jk: submitted ARK panel proposal for Dec CNI meeting  <br>mg: ok to forward EOSC PID workshop to other ARKA working groups<br><br>December 13th : Rencontres 2022 de la donnée culturelle (Data Forum for FR Cultural Institutions) : one of the presentations will be the Louvre's Collections portal https://collections.louvre.fr/ : the project, and the ARK permanent identifier attributed to each work displayed. |
| Any news items we should blog about? |     | jk: will  work with rv on a community update blog post, with an  updated map |
| Summary of the past month activities |     | *   13 assignment requests, 4 update requests.<br>*   11 new NAANs, 5 updates (2 through the curation form, 3 direct manual updates, as they were recent entries).<br>*   1 pending assignment request: [#55](https://github.com/CDLUC3/naan_reg_priv/issues/55).<br>*   [#54](https://github.com/CDLUC3/naan_reg_priv/issues/54): test ARKs, regex in the registration form needs to be changed (I like regex but I did not dare to propose a new pattern myself!)<br>*   Bug in the update process through the curation form: for [#57](https://github.com/CDLUC3/naan_reg_priv/issues/57), I had to do it manually because the form tried to do a NAAN assignment and failed.<br>*   New request, but the organization already has a NAAN : [#49](https://github.com/CDLUC3/naan_reg_priv/issues/49). Be cautious not to assign a new NAAN; agents might forget one of their predecessors already requested a NAAN.<br>*   [#46](https://github.com/CDLUC3/naan_reg_priv/issues/46): though there is a doubt on which entity the NAAN is requested (does the provider requests it for a client organization or their entire system?), the warning in the answer is considered sufficient. |
| Communication on certain NAAN assignment process |     | When an issue arises, to have a discussion between all group members. <br><br>*   email to requesters (Github is private)<br>*   the group email still exists<br>*   To adress issues of all kind (technical, or eligibility or else), the Github team group offers a way to notify the whole group @CDLIC3/naan-registry with a link to the specific request card |
| Action items from last time<br><br>- [ ] John Kunze clarify and revise the checklist and policy docs to guide curators on use and encouragement of shoulders instead of NAANs; ask rv for feedback<br>- [x] John Kunze change contact form email to forward to Outreach |     | Started! |
| Who is primary curator in the next few months?<br><br>next month: Chloé/Aurélien |     | Next meeting on Dec 21th. |
