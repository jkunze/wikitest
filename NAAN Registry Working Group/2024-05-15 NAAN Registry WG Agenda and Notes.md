| Item | Who | Notes |
| Announcements |     | jk: Everyone in this group should yet have received a github invitation to maintain content on the arks.org website (supported by the "github pages" mechanism). Also, I really enjoyed the opportunity to meet some of the members of the group in Paris. |
| Any news items we should blog about? Any calls for papers, submission deadlines, upcoming meetings we should note? Please add to [Calendar of events](Calendar-of-events_208341505.html). |     |     |
| Status of new NAAN processing developments at CDL |     | No updates. At yesterday's Technical WG, it was confirmed that some discrepancies with the resolver have to be dealt with before the NAAN processing changes can occur. |
| Review of [in-progress issues](https://github.com/CDLUC3/naan_reg_priv/projects/1) |     | 17 new NAAN requests, no update request. |
| Personal archival organizations |     | jk: should we as a group develop some guidelines for assessing requests that come in from tiny organizations that are possibly only concerned with personal data/content? On the one hand, we're pretty liberal with request from orgs that are (a) brand new (eg, no website yet) and (b) small (anticipating growth). On the other hand, we don't want people to abuse the registry for purely personal information or self-promotion (including family genealogy).  <br>jm: do we have any public criteria that can be used to help people decide whether they meet the criteria before submitting request?  <br>jk: we've never committed to a public policy, but maybe we should go public with a little bit more than we have  <br>rv: some seem to be personal sites, such as one devoted to the requester's father's works. Perhaps one criterion should be whether the subject  is of general interest? what extra questions can we ask?  <br>ac: we have accepted one request to host personal research data of general interest, and in that case the subject was not the researcher's own family. It was an individual's effort, but scholarship of general interest.  <br>jk: so maybe we should consider additional questions to put to the requester to press them a little on things like preservation plan, growth of the organization, and scope of the  subject matter  <br>rv: we could start by adding a note to the curator checklist<br><br>Zoom chat:rv: Mine was: [https://wolfgangkirk.de/](https://wolfgangkirk.de/)  <br>jc: I agree that the liberal nature of registering is a key feature of ARKs.  <br>We already ask a preservation question in the form, correct?  <br>I need to drop off. But I would worry about putting up too many barriers. |
| Curator changeover as of today (standing schedule always found on group home page) |     | Chloé primary, Aurélien secondary. |
