| Item | Who | Notes |
| Announcements |     | Getting close to 1000 NAANs<br><br>John ordered a trial set of ARKA stickers |
| Calls for papers, submission deadlines, upcoming meetings: [Calendar of events](Calendar-of-events_208341505.html) |     |     |
| Any news items we should blog about? |     |     |
| Question about metadata requirements with regard to location | Maria Gould | Technically yes, we can process requests without a location on a case-by-case basis, but a physical address is preferred<br><br>We do not want to automatically discount virtual organizations because these are becoming more common |
| Github project for NAAN requests | Maria Gould | Maria has set up a lightweight parallel workflow on Github to practice working with requests. New requests are now automatically being converted to Github issues. Recommend that whoever is on duty tries it out (set up 15 minutes with Maria to do a walkthrough together). This does not (yet) replace the normal workflow, but it is a way to start experimenting with a new approach.<br><br>A couple of outstanding to-do items:<br><br>1.  It would be great for someone to figure out a script for automatically adding new issues to the project board.<br>2.  The Github issue format cannot be validated by the N2T form. Maria is working with CDL developer to fix this. |
| Status of Gsuite discussion | John Kunze | Discussion still unresolved |
| Update on code of conduct work | Brian McBride | No update yet |
| Review curator schedule / meeting responsibilities | Maria Gould | Curator on duty should be responsible for hosting the meeting the falls at the end of their month.<br><br>The term officially ends when the monthly meeting begins. |
