| Question about NAAN request from CIAT - ok to approve? | Maria | Yes, we all agree this is fine to proceed |     |
| Ideas about what to do about issues/requests that haven't had any activity | Maria | We would like to propose closing these requests after 90 days if they have not had any activity. We should have a standing agenda item for the monthly meeting to check in on the pending issues and discuss whether they can be closed. We also agree that we should not spend time sending follow-up emails if they do not respond to our initial inquiries. |     |
| Change of curators starting with today's meeting | Maria | Romuald taking over through October 18 (Aurélien as back-up) |     |
