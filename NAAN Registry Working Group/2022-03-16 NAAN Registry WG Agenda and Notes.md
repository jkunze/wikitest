| Moving away from jkunze github repo. |     | Proposal to move to a CDL repository. Agreed.<br><br>Long-term goal should be to move to an Ark Alliance Github repo.<br><br>Institutional repository are easier to reference and contribute to. |
| Working more via github issues, less via email? Example: requester responds to a NAAN curator's email with another emailed question about support. Recipients include the NAAN list and the curator. Who should respond to it? What if the question comes when the curator is "off duty"? |     | Proposal to integrate more into Github (via Zapier?) to avoid multi-tools process (Google form, mails Github process & request tracking)<br><br>MG: I will look into setting things up |
