| Time | Item | Who | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | Reiterate WG goals |     | Regarding policy, AC mentioned GDPR protections. MG said ROR registry has some sensitivity to geographic area names, alternate names, and language issues. BC asked if the 24-hour promise was legally binding? Answer: no, it's just a service target |
|     | Member introductions |     | AC said some of the challenges are that many of the French archives are not so active and links aren't so permanent. |
|     | Selection of chairs/co-chairs |     | Deferred |
|     | Establish meeting schedule |     | All: monthly meetings are fine, the second Monday of each month. |
|     | Logistics (email list? call technology, note-taking, reporting to AG) |     | get AC's wiki credentials re-sent<br><br>put Slack topic on next month's agenda (set up AITO workspace?) |
|     | *   promotion of new NAAN request form<br>*   updates vs new requests<br>*   progress to date on github automation<br>*   alternative: google form Apps Script?<br>*   who in this group is willing to handle NAAN requests? |     | BC: twitter is a good way to promote; we haven't pushed much to the arks-forum in a while.  <br>MG: batch update outreach would be good<br><br>AC: still trying to recruit NAAN curators from French archivists  <br>JK: looking to recruit people with expertise in googleforms Apps Script (or github actions/workflows)<br><br>AC: I'm willing to do some curation along with Brian and Bertrand<br><br>BC: revised google form: are there any changes compared the previous one?  <br>JK: nothing important, and changed form didn't break automation<br><br>BC: perhaps it would be good to translate the form letter response to French  <br>All: agreed  <br>Brian: what about translation to Spanish, given number of requests?  <br>JK: right, let's first do another pass to dust off the English version; Maria and Aurélien will review the response letter |
