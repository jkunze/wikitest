| status of update feature on curator form |     | JK: tour of proposed changes; invitation for feedback now or as we get more experience with it; idea of folding in update feature is so that updates are subject both to validation and publication (so that changes are harvested correctly by n2t)<br><br>All: changes seem reasonable so far |
| NAAN request form change |     | B: what about Dartmouth<br><br>JK: to make it easier for service providers to shield their clients from confusion when unexpected email arrives from NAAN request form: propose change to ask that Contact email be the provider, while NAAN-holder contact be captured elsewhere<br><br>M: mainly want to avoid confusion from the NAAN registry<br><br>A: vendors have told institutions to request NAANs themselves |
