| Time | Item | Who | Notes |
|     | announcements |     | Chloé Pochon will launch an enquiry (a google doc form) among FR users of arks to know more precisely how much they use the system and which kind of support they would need to develop their use.<br><br>Another Questionnaire will be sent to main archival services in FR not using arks, to know why, when or whether they are using other kinds of PIDs<br><br>John Kunze will be on a panel ("Broken for all") in the Open Repository Meetings (June 9th) about the lack of PIDs in archiving and digital object management systems; on a related theme, also participating in a "Lighting the Way" IMLS grant project |
|     | web form progress<br><br>*   first ever use with response letter<br><br>supervised rollout proposed<br><br>[https://n2t.net/e/admin/naanq2e.html](https://n2t.net/e/admin/naanq2e.html) |     | The email response mailed out today was the first one generated by the new web form, which is now installed in production N2T. It has the error correcting mechanism, email is sent to requester, and changes are committed back to github.<br><br>\==>Next request : supervised rollout with Chloe/Aurélien/John. |
|     | curators share experiences<br><br>*   what worked<br>*   what didn't work<br>*   policy tweaks? |     | Edge cases experienced with OpnFonR (individual researcher looking to maintain a dataset coming from his PhD and exotic Unicode in org name). Important thing is persistence, eg, a data management plan.<br><br>Internet Archive could also be a solution to provide persistent storage to scholars; CDL in ongoing discussions with them about adding ARKs to such materials.<br><br>Whenever a mistake is found or an improvement suggested, curators are asked to update README.md and Policy.md.<br><br>JK: Recent experience with the emailed intellectual assessment has gone well for my purposes.<br><br>\==>Curator checklist should be in context in the form, or linked to the form<br><br>For Profit / Non Profit is to be used to differentiate "business units" (maybe less committed to data persistence) from institutions which have sustainability in their core missions. Not Private/Public institutions : e.g. Established Universities will be NP, regardless of private/public status. |
