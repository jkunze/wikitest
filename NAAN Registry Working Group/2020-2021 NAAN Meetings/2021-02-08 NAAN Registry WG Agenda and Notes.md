| Time | Item | Who | Notes |
|     | announcements |     | *   Institute of the Arab World (France) requested a NAAN,  Bertrand is reaching out to get clarification as the org already has an existing NAAN |
|     | upcoming meetings, calls for papers, submission deadlines<br><br>1.  Consider proposing a CNI session (March 15-26) -- **deadline Feb 12** -- please let the group know if you did or are planning to submit something.<br>2.  Consider doing a blog post or news item for an upcoming ARKA newsletter; you can submit an idea at [arks.org/blog/submit](http://arks.org/blog/submit).<br>3.  Consider presenting at the PASIG (Preservation and Archiving Special Interest Group) in September. The call is not out, but informally I'm told they'll be interested in ARKA topics.<br>4.  If you haven't already done so, please inform your networks of the Jan 26 rollout (below), which you can do by forwarding [this announcement](https://arks.org/blog/announcing-the-ark-alliance/) . |     | *   Contact form has not been used for official correspondence.<br>*   Opening rate for emails is about 6-8%, best practice is to stagger emails out to increase likelihood of emails being read.<br>*   Next outreach meeting, discuss the new site and outreach possibilities.<br>*   Has there been an uptick in new NAAN requests? John Kunze |
|     | third party NAAN assignment<br><br>*   the EZID service asks for NAANs on behalf of other institutions – should other service organizations such as BnL and ARKetype be able to do the same thing? |     | *   Roxana National Library of Luxembourg asked if a third party can ask on behalf of an organization? Not seen as an issue, however documentation is needed for the process and procedures. Defining what it is, what it means, etc<br>*   EZID has two ways for creating NAANs, one for UC schools and one for non-UC schools. CDL will fill out necessary work for all UC schools.<br>*   MG: language is pretty clear on the request form; important that the NAAN org understands it's ultimately responsible for persistence of objects |
|     | small ongoing NAAN task #1<br><br>*   investigating legitimacy of edge-case requests (less than one per month)<br>*   how to share the maintenance burden across WG members – one person and one backup person designated for 3-6 months? other ideas? |     | *   Expectation to respond to NAAN request within 48 hours (M-F)<br>*   John Kunze will handle the technical components of creating a NAAN<br>*   Bertrand Caron  Brian McBride (after April) aurélien conraux are available to work on the email correspondence tasks<br>*   General consensus on 6 month rotation and one backup to ensure coverage for vacations and holidays<br>*   Consensus to not work weekends; 48 turnaround on NAAN requests should mean 2 business days<br>*   Create a page on the wiki that lists the assignments and rotations |
|     | small ongoing NAAN task #2<br><br>*   by-hand addition of newly registered NAAN addresses into global map<br>*   but consider larger context of [three general solutions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QZXiZFkNwmW82LQ4ggggM1XpVfAjv73csnBuGFdKJP4/edit?usp=sharing) |     | *   Bertrand is looking into how to model the GEO data in wikidata for NAAN registrant mapping project and assigning NAAN id to wikidata page<br>*   Google maps import of TSV/CSV data might be the simplest method for map project.<br>*   OpenStreatmap option<br>*   Keeping the map up-to-date is a lower priority task.<br>*   Task 1 and Task 2 should be done by the same curator team on assignment.<br>*   GeoNames - [https://www.geonames.org/](https://www.geonames.org/) |
