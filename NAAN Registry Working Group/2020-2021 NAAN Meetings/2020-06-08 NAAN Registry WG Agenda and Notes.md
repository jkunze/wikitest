|     | Action item from last time: (regarding the question of why la Mayenne had at least 3 different resolver URLs and what the best plan for future resolution is while not breaking old ARKs.<br><br>aurélien conraux Will reach out to Archives départementales de la Mayenne regarding N2T inquiry for updating records regarding organization URL <br><br>*   I had a call with the Archives départementales de la Mayenne team, and their situation is as follows :<br>    <br>    *   In 2018 their provider for their resource-sharing website, Archimaine\*, started to use arks but with an unasked for twist : the root of the URL wasn’t the institution’s address/server, but [http://www.archinoe](http://www.archinoe/), which is a Archimaine’s server.<br>    *   In 2019 Mayenne moved to a new provider, AJLSM, and paid Archimaine what they tought would be a one-time sum to redirect the arks.<br>    <br>    Their new platform will be under the Département’s name, and the root of the ark URL will eventually be stg like [https://archive.lamayenne.fr/XXX](https://archive.lamayenne.fr/XXX)<br>    <br>    But…<br>    <br>    IT for some reasons prefers the arks to temporarily originate from a “chercher” \[search\] sub-domain while they are piecing different modules together in the new site.<br>    <br>    (as a possible explanation, I mention that Archives départementales’s sites often are, because of digitized pictures and documents, the largest websites of the French “states”/départements, and thus local governments are particularly afraid they might crash during their mandate).<br>    <br>    èHence the various URLs mentioned in the correspondence.<br>    <br>    *   In 2020, Archimaine is still asking Mayenne to cover up the costs of the redirection server and maintains a table of correspondence between obsolete “archinoe”’arks and current ones. Mayenne would like to get rid of that too to sever the links with the provider.<br>    <br>    èAn idea to avoid an ongoing business relation between them would be to redirect all previous archinoe/Mayenne ark links to a resolver, so that people clicking on old links would be routed through N2T.<br>    <br>    Could that become a standard practice (and contractual clause) ? At least 3 other “Archives départementales” are in the same “archinoe” situation because of Archimaine : Maine, Vendée, Loire-Atlantique.<br>    <br>    Also of interest on the French ark landscape :<br>    <br>    *   the National Genealogy Association (FFG) has been in contact with my department for a June meeting and general agreement to push forward permalinks in all French archival institutions.<br>    *   Various head of Archives départementales have expressed an interest, given the rapid rise in webconferencing tools’ use due to COVID, to create a “permalink taskforce”. I’m looking for time in my schedule and that might be part of a job vacancy I hope to fulfill by the beginning of July. | John, Aurélien | Takeaway thoughts (while waiting for further insights from Aurélien as well):<br><br>*   Vendors need to understand (consequences of) their choices.<br><br>*   Resolution shouldn't be handled by vendor<br><br>*   Re: vendor asking for payment for resolution, is this something N2T could mitigate in the future?<br><br>Aurélien: Meeting on Wednesday with working group of regional archive directors and genealogists to establish a set of best practices for ARKs and permanent identifiers and will use the Mayenne case as example to build framework for relationships with providers<br><br>FFG: Brian interested in staying informed |
|     | Action item from last time:<br><br>Bertrand Caron Will [draft an email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iwvv6gARkR8JGnRZaL4FkPnx1RPMKKSTWsY_0J65FJg/edit?usp=sharing) message to the English ARKs list to encourage community to update their organization information for the ARK registry | Bertrand | Have not seen overwhelming response to French version of letter.<br><br>Who should be signatory on the letter?<br><br>*   Decision: Bertrand Caron, on behalf of NAAN Registry Working Group<br><br>End of Wednesday (June 10): Deadline for WG members to proofread/comment<br><br>Bertrand to send out on Thursday (June 11) |
|     | - [ ] Clarify and add documentation pertaining to the "reserved" status of 99999 NAAN John Kunze<br>- [ ] Create document as stub registry of current test shoulders under 99999 NAAN John Kunze<br>- [ ] Document the test shoulders assigned to the 99999 NAAN and how to use it to avoid conflicts John Kunze | John | John has been adding some text to the ARK FAQ to clarify what the NAAN is for so it can introduce the concept of shoulders and explain which shoulders are reserved for test shoulders and vocabularies. Text still under construction but feedback is welcome. <br><br>Bertrand: Difficult to detect diff from Confluence notifications when John makes a change. Is there an easier way to indicate what has been updated so Bertrand can make the corresponding change to the French version? <br><br>John: Note that update is still in progress but will update the differences document for both French and Spanish versions |
