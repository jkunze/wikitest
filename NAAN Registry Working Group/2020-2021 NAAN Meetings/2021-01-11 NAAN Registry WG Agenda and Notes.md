Is this trend going to continue ?<br><br>AC: Intern in March/April (4 month) in SIAF in 2021 for an end of college project about ark in French institutions.

|     | Subtask: NAAN Map Maintenance<br><br>What this is for: maintain of the official public-facing world map of registered NAAN holders, linked now from arks.org/community <br><br>Platform: currently google maps -- free (open to alternatives)<br><br>**Wanted**: 1 or 2 people to help review, refine, and document this subtask<br><br>Frequency: ? Not more than 6 times per year<br><br>Steps to create new map:  <br>   Go to [mymaps.google.com](http://mymaps.google.com)  <br>   Create  <br>   Import map.tsv  <br>   \* to do: figure out how to automatically get map.tsv to google drive  <br>   Fiddle with flag icons (small dot, red)  <br>   Fix a few Addresses  <br>   Update NAAN registry on github with address fixes  <br>   \* to do: figure out how to automatically get new map.tsv to google drive  <br>   \* to do: figure out protocol for getting stable offical map link to point to new map<br><br>Alternate: Steps to modify existing official map:  <br>   Go to existing map  <br>   Open its "data table"  <br>   \* to do: figure out how one curator can alter another curator's map,  <br>            (or maybe just copy their map, alter the copy, and make  <br>            the new copy the "official" map?)  <br>   Add new addresses by hand  <br>   \* to do: figure out how to automate that |     | As of today , a separate task from the registry, updated regularly (691 institutions) but not dynamically : capture of screens on a personal google map, in which are imported the location data a .tsv file. The data comes from the N2T (and also drives data visualization of naan holders), is stored on a google drive. The data has columns (geolocation and labels have to be manually specified) and some addresses are not displayed properly : the map doesn’t always get the distinction between "postal" addresses and "geographical" addresses for institutions. Also, visualization parameters have to be manually set for improved reading.<br><br>Aurélien : ask FranceArchives data geolocation team how they operate and which free, sustainable tools they recommend<br><br>Bertrand to explore inserting geolocations into wikidata for naan holders and use direct queries from wikidata map<br><br>Issues : automation/access rights to the source document |
|     | NAAN and Shoulder Form Maintenance  <br>   Go to [n2t.net/e/shoulder\_request](http://n2t.net/e/shoulder_request)  <br>   \* to do: figure out how one curator can alter another curator's form  <br>   ? or is this easy with some "sharing" setting?<br><br>Volunteers? |     | Update on maintenance tasks: demo of new forms with the "ARK Alliance" banner and logo. |
|     | status of NAAN entry form |     | Some progress towards pre-validation of new naan entry with respect to rest of naan registry |
