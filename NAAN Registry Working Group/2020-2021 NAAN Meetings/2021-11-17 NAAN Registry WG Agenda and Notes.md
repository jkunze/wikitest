| Recent NAAN decisions worth mentioning? |     | *   2 (probably) "test" requests, which did not reply to request for additional information <br><br>\==>the curator in charge of the first request follows the request until completion or decision to drop, and if necessary briefs his/her successor.<br><br>*   end of Learn&Go series of requests : it is vital to always check whether a company/institution has already a NAAN<br><br>*   When a new NAAN is selected in the candidate\_naan file but the request ultimately is not completed, the selected NAAN stays in a limbo : neither attrbuted to an organization nor available.<br><br>\==> The roll back is a manual process : cut and paste the NAAN, then paste it back in the list of available NAANs in the candidate\_naans file<br><br>the curator in charge of the initial selection has to do it, since it might also be an error on an update: in which case the NAAN must NOT be made available again. |
| Next month curator duty (Brian/Maria) |     |     |
| Reminder of wiki editing privileges |     | All group members should be able to directly edit the wiki. |
