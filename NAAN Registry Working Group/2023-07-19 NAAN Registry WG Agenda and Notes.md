| Summary of past month requests | Bertrand Caron | *   Dash in organization base URLs provided in the NAAN creation form keeps being an issue. (Reminder: the regex is **^\\s\*(https?://)?\\w+(\\.\\w+)+/?\\\\?$**)<br>    <br><br>\==>Proposal to use the Google menu "URL" instead of a REGEX. <br><br>If not see how to modify the existing REGEX (^\\s\*(https?://)?\\w+(\\.\\w+)+/?\\\\?$     ?)<br><br>*   Contact name: shouldn't we choose between a double field "surname" / "given name" or never trying to make a guess (e.g., in the registry "last name, first name" or in the automated reply). Even for WG members it's hard to determine (for example: "Mozaherul Hoque Abul Hasanat").<br><br>\==> Bertrand will send an email to the whole group to get feedback from other members.<br><br>*   NAAN for a biographical dictionary: should we ask the requester to categorize the "things" the NAAN and the ARKs are meant to be assigned to?<br><br>\==> These already exist in the planned evolutions of n2t. Maria will check the field "purpose" (which thing the ARKs will be assigned to) is repeatable. <br><br>*   Uncertain postal addresses (e.g., Paraje Villavieja, 10359, Romangordo, Extremadura, Spain): though Google Maps returns 0 or more than one result, should we change a probably legit address?<br><br>\==> Plans are to reduce the precision to the city and add controlled lists for city and country. So if there is a doubt, keeping just the "city" level seems enough. |
