| Item | Who | Notes |
| Announcements |     | JM: can help to review/edit any blog post (Sefakor? Andy Irving? John O'Malley?)<br><br>Blog post template developed by the Outreach WG. |
| Any news items we should blog about? Any calls for papers, submission deadlines, upcoming meetings we should note? Please add to [Calendar of events](Calendar-of-events_208341505.html). |     | WAC 2024: JK is coming to Paris.<br><br>JK found a slot to give a speculative talk about how ARKs could work for web archives.<br><br>Ad hoc submissions for iPRES |
| Status of new NAAN processing developments at CDL |     | JC: Still working on the backend system. Will keep the group updated. N2T upgrade has not been made yet. |
| review of [in-progress issues](https://github.com/CDLUC3/naan_reg_priv/projects/1) |     | 21 new NAAN requests (out of which one is still pending), 3 update requests. |
| Questions related to the NAAN curation activities in the past month. |     | BC: Question regarding the update procedure for EZID clients. Might be a temporary procedure as it will probably change with upcoming infrastructure changes. Generally, resolver information in the registry is ignored. But if not, it should be right.<br><br>BC: doubts about update request [#402](https://github.com/CDLUC3/naan_reg_priv/issues/402)<br><br>Information about the base URL registrant was default registrar information, probably used also by scammers, which would explain that it appeared in scams. Best practice: try to reach out to registered contacts.<br><br>BC: enforce recommendation for only one contact entry point per NAAN? Best practice: recommend submitting role account, and having just one contact entry point per NAAN. |
| Curator changeover as of today |     | Romuald primary, Brian secondary. |

Action items
------------

- [ ] JC: ask Dave Vieglais about why an update request came from an EZID client.
