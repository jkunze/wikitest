First newsletter ideas and mock-up – Jan 2021
=============================================

**ARK Alliance Newsletter, 2021, Volume 1, Issue 1**

We are thrilled to announce the **ARK Alliance**. The ARK Alliance is the newly minted name for the global community that uses ARKs (Archival Resource Keys) as persistent identifiers in the scholarly ecosystem. That community was created by the very successful ARKs-in-the-Open project, begun in December 2018, as a collaboration between the California Digital Library (CDL) and LYRASIS/DuraSpace. With the foundation laid, the established initiative will go forward in partnership with LYRASIS as the **ARK Alliance**.

Growth, numbers, map

N2T ARK resolutions in 2019

**The new brand**

Besides the new name, we have a new website, **[arks.org](http://arks.org)**. It’s early days so the site is still in the process of incorporating material held at the ARKsInTheOpen.org wiki and at the N2T.net resolver. Only ARK-specific information pages will move from N2T, which will carry on uninterrupted as the global ARK resolver.

The ARK Alliance Working Groups and Advisory Group will continue to be supported by the ARKsInTheOpen.org wiki.

There is also a new twitter handle: **@arks\_org**. All followers of the former handle (@ARKsInTheOpen) are automatically already followers of the new handle. The old hashtag, #ARKsInTheOpen, is deprecated.

**Since our last community update**

The [ARKs in the Open](https://arksintheopen.org) (AITO) newsletter is published quarterly to provide an overview of the latest activities of the open and international initiative established around Archival Resource Keys (ARKs) and their use as persistent identifiers in the open scholarly ecosystem.

Announcements

### Over 600 organizations assign ARKs

As of April 2020, [more than 600 organizations](https://n2t.net/e/pub/naan_registry.txt) have registered to create ARK identifiers. (...)

### ARKs in the Open: 3.2 billion Persistent Identifiers

Bess Missell (Smithsonian Institution), Karen Hanson (Ithaka), Tom Creighton (FamilySearch International), and John Kunze (California Digital Library) gave a [presentation](https://www.cni.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/John-Kunze-ARKs-cni-sp-20.pdf) last April at the CNI Spring 2020 virtual event where they shared the most recent developments on the ARK scheme, the AITO project as well as implementation experiences from each of their institutions.

### INCIPIT - an ARK allocation service based in Switzerland

[INCIPIT](https://www.swissuniversities.ch/en/topics/digitalisation/p-5-scientific-information/projects/incipit) is a one-year project led by the Haute école de gestion de Genève which aims to develop a complementary infrastructure in Switzerland for the low-cost attribution of persistent identifiers to any concept or resource based on the ARK scheme. While having a Swiss scope, INCIPIT 2020 is involved in the AITO initiative as well as collaborating with the California Digital Library, notably on a shared software approach to mint identifiers.
