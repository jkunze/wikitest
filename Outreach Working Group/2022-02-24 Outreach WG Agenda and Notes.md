| Item | Who | Notes |
| Announcements |     | Ricc Ferrante, Director of Digital Services, joins the working group from Smithsonian Library and Archives. He will also act as ARKA Advisory Group liaison. The Smithsonian Library and Archives has a new director: Tamar Evangelestia-Dougherty.  <br>Tracy Seneca will be much involved with the iPRES conference series in the next two years and will be rotating off our working group. |
| Calls for papers, submission deadlines, upcoming meetings: [Calendar of events](Calendar-of-events_208341505.html) |     | Tracy reminds us that the iPRES conference call is coming up soon.  <br>The CNI call deadline is tomorrow.  <br>rf: I will put the word out at Smithsonian about future venues to present at |
| Any news items we should blog about? |     | see below |
| Blog post about IIIF and ARK congruence delayed | Julien | Julien regrets he cannot attend today |
| wikipedia page expansion status | Peter | pc: made the promised changes to the wikipedia history section of the ARK identifier page  <br>jk: looks good; some of the notes references are repeated up to 3 times  <br>pc: yes, I will fix it  <br>rf: how are changes made to that page? are there volunteers?jk: yes, just raise your hand if you're interested; the group will review changes<br><br>pc: fixed the wikipedia references just now |
| getting started doc |     | jk: sorry if I'm holding this up; something seems incomplete and I'm wondering if it got enough review  <br>mg: it would be better than what we have now, and I'd like to see it referenced in the NAAN response letter; we currently say "that's all you need to do for now", but that's not really true  <br>jk: could be considered "beta" and subject to revision; I suppose it can be safely undiscoverable until we link to it?  <br>all: yes  <br>ACTION: jk to push out a review draft on arks.org |
| ARK spec status and transition planning. Would like to propose a joint operation with Technical WG.<br><br>Draft here |     | jk: how will the smithsonian react to the transition?  <br>rf: I will try to find out  <br>jk: maybe we need a more detailed list of changes and suggestions of what groups will be affected  <br>rf: do we have a quorum on this?  <br>pc: it seems like Outreach WG has the role of telling people who will be affected by the transition planpc: seems like one key channel is the NAAN holders; can we share the news with them  <br>jk: yes, we have contact info for all of them, not necessarily up-to-date; there was one round of updates a few years ago  <br>rf: can we ask them to verify their contact info by point them to a form for updating the info?  <br>jk: should we ask them suggestions about how to support them in the transition? is a a survey too much?  <br>pc: we could ask them for ideas in a somewhat open-ended way, for example, and email that<br><br>1.  asks they update info it they're not the right person (do this up front since they might not read further)<br>2.  asks for suggestions, such as (list of concrete examples)<br>3.  plus text of blog post<br><br>jk: seems like this should also go to other channels, like arks-forum email list and french version; also to twitter  <br>all: yes  <br>rf: who is the "sender" for content going out via email? we should have a generic role account  <br>jk: often it is a personal account, but this isn't a good long term strategy  <br>mg: there are good alternatives; for the services I run, I use a generic gmail account; in fact, for NAAN response letters I would prefer to send them from a generic role account  <br>rf: with microsoft products I use, one can change which identity one is sending from; maybe from gmail too  <br>ACTION: look into role accounts for communication |
