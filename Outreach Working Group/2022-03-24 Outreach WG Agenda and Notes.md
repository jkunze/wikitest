| Item | Who | Notes |
| Announcements |     | jk: low turnout today – probably should have reminded people that the US changed clocks two weeks earlier than Europe |
| Calls for papers, submission deadlines, upcoming meetings: [Calendar of events](Calendar-of-events_208341505.html) |     |     |
| Any news items we should blog about? |     |     |
| ARK & IIIF blog post – call for reviewers |     | jk: exciting topic and great embedded videos, but dense  <br>jr: yes, could use to be broken down into simpler pieces; could get interesting use cases from BnF and Durham Library  <br>jk: I'd be available to help with the next round of edits |
| Quickstart guide ready to go out?<br><br>*   current [gdoc version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JHVJa-s6kBlj7OpIi1Vbk0S9pNt1WAygSfHTdnrO0t8/edit)<br>*   current [arks.org WP version](https://arks.org/about/getting-started-implementing-arks/)<br>*   question: ok to link to it from QUICKSTART top menu label?<br>*   ok to point to it from NAAN response letter? |     | all: changes are ok; interim best top level menu label (short, accurate) is "GET STARTED"<br><br>all: fine to point to this page from the NAAN response letter<br><br>ACTION: jk will make these changes |
| ARK spec transition planning<br><br>*   blog post out (softly); big change is from ark:/12345 to ark:12345<br>*   how do we make first noises – twitter, email forum, direct email to implementers?<br>*   when do we change documentation on website and wikipedia?<br>*   when do we ask implementers to honor the new form?<br>*   what tools do we give them (eg, an online validity checker)? |     | mg: when would it take effect, how much lead time is needed?  <br>mg: if it is permanently backward compatible, does that disincentive people from changing?  <br>jk: who can craft the transition plan?  <br>mg: happy to be part of a group that does that, but don't have time to lead it or strategize  <br>jk: who else should be part of the planning? Bnf, Smithsonian, Internet Archive, Portico, Nat'l Library of Luxembourg |
| New NAAN form asks more questions<br><br>\-- ask also what software platform they're planning to use? (this would help prioritize our documentation and outreach) |     | mg: makes sense; in addition to some common platforms, make sure to have an "I don't know" choice  <br>jr: for IIIF community we regularly have surveys for this kind of question  <br>ACTION: jk will make add question to form |
