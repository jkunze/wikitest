| Item | Who | Notes |
| Announcements |     | Donny Winston some outreach (not necessarily related to ARK but it was mentioned) done for FAIR Data Podcast ([https://www.researchspace.com/fair-data-podcast](https://www.researchspace.com/fair-data-podcast)). |
| Calls for papers, submission deadlines, upcoming meetings: [Calendar of events](Calendar-of-events_208341505.html) |     | Donny Winston  will go to the 1st FAIR Digital Objects Conference [https://www.fdo2022.org/](https://www.fdo2022.org/) in Leiden. |
| Any news items we should blog about? |     |     |
| New WG member John Jung |     | Welcome to John, programmer Analyst at the University of Chicago Library! Among other things, John works on minting ARKs and IIIF. |
| New ARK service [U of Toronto Scarborough](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/16774) |     | Article published on Code4Lib about a new "EZID-light" service which contains its own resolver. <br><br>John Kunze will reach out to them and see if they can be involved in the ARK Alliance. |
| Some stickers version 2 (beta) starter ideas<br><br>![](attachments/257720336/257720542.png) |     | ![](attachments/257720336/257720563.png)?<br><br>jr: hex-shaped stickers are better than circular stickers<br><br>John Jung: 3 or 4. Perhaps we should add something on the sticker that states that this is about persistent identifiers? I have access to Adobe Illustrator if that helps<br><br>dw: could  add URL into the boat to be more compact, but I don't feel strongly; like adding "persistent ids"; maybe try adding words on side of ship for compactness; maybe using ark:99166 (organizational NAAN) as a self-referential ARK for the ARK Alliance?<br><br>Maria Gould : Combination of 4 (ARK Alliance above) and 3 (arks.org below), but not separating the url like in 5.<br><br>jj: I like that the boards have a gap at the bow, to make it a 3d object<br><br>dw: incidentally, why don't we use the "arks" topic ("github topic") in our github repo, like [https://github.com/topics/arks](https://github.com/topics/arks) does? (the "ark" topic gets lots of stuff that would not work well for us) |

Action items
------------

- [x] The Johns to look at the IIIF blog post series that Julien Antoine Raemy wrote.
- [x] Why don't we use the "arks" topic in our github repo, like [https://github.com/topics/arks](https://github.com/topics/arks) does?
