|     | updating the [expression of interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ylEeI3hUVHcLl-wNtDI7-F7JReBtVbgx65y9Uiy78q8/edit)<br><br>*   no longer serves original purpose<br>*   what should it say now? |     | Maria recommended links to relevant working group pages. Tracy recommended adjusting the text to be more of an invitation, less history.  Bertrand recommended more clear participation in working groups - we'll need these as membership changes.  John discussed secondary opportunity to communicate more in the confirmation message in the EOI form.  <br><br>Can we put invitations to join a working group on each WG page?  What email address do we post there?
