|     | announcements |     | Welcome to Bess Missel (Smithsonian) and to our two guests from the CDL (UX team), Rachael Hu and John Kratz who have been invited to talk about the logo planning. |
|     | AITO logo planning<br><br>Note: (1) we own the domain arks.org (but right now it just redirects to n2t.net) and  <br>(2) Tracy suggested maybe we could change our name from ARKs-in-the-Open to something else, maybe "The ARK Alliance"?<br><br>All: do any of you know how to go about designing an ARK logo? Artists who might contribute logo ideas? |     | A logo would be great as a stepping stone. Naming and branding identity are at the forefront. What adjectives would we use to describe our community/effort? What flavours of things are we looking at? Visual ideas could be drafted upon these ideas/questions (= some assignments would have to be done by the Outreach WG members, such as an identity exercise). We might be able to lead the group through a branding exercise.<br><br>How long would these exercises take? Probably one or two meetings may be necessary. Tracy is mentioning the Open Canvas exercise she carried out for AITO and that it was difficult to really assess what the scope of the project was.<br><br>Tracy: Is AITO an aspiration? Should the name reflect more of the long-term vision, eg, the ARK Alliance? Should ARK be expanded to Archival Resource Key in a new name?<br><br>The meeting attendees agree to go ahead and do the exercises with Rachael and John Kratz. They will get back to the Outreach WG in the coming weeks.<br><br>Tracy: the identity/logo discussion may be good to have around a deeper look into the Open Canvas process |
|     | finish the rest of the sections of the [Resources and Values wiki page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vfJv7P6WVjYG8GsYrJYJUOuwX-u4hbVPj_XhHOk0cOw/edit?usp=sharing)<br><br>[Tracy's AITO OpenCanvas](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uCfg4wC-_atuXTHG9EdaB_-HPjsQYcinWKcpGjp3oXk/edit) - [one of the first steps](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/develop-an-open-project-strategy-with-open-canvas/)/tools when starting a project | Tracy | All: look at Tracy's revisions and confirm they look good<br><br>Are we talking about ARKs in the Open? or an initiative that will lead to something else?<br><br>John Kunze: AITO will eventually lead us to the "eternal flame" of the ARK scheme.<br><br>Tracy: perhaps we should look at the rest of the workshop and then come back to the document as well as assess if doing the rest of the online workshop for AITO makes sense. At least, we should have a look at the workshop and see what tools/methods may be useful to us.<br><br>Rachael: perhaps the OpenCanvas exercise may overlap with the identity exercise |
|     | start mocking up some newsletter sections<br><br>*   Title and short description<br>    *   **ARKs in the Open Newsletter, YYYY, Issue X**<br>    *   _The [ARKs in the Open](https://arksintheopen.org) (AITO) newsletter is published quarterly to provide an overview of the latest activities of the open and international initiative established around Archival Resource Keys (ARKs) and their use as persistent identifiers in the open scholarly ecosystem._<br>*   Announcements<br>*   AITO Groups’ latest updates<br>*   Useful links<br>*   Newsletter submission<br><br>[Mock-up of the first newsletter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PzF6I4e2kqJ55UoAMxIwfW51Nu2Inw5p1XRxh5zPMuc/edit#heading=h.7svvfwx1qka) | Julien | Frequency: at least quarterly, but it could be more (without committing to more) - or two to three batches a year to be a "catch-all" summary<br><br>Peter: we could use Mailchimp (which could be coupled with anything that generate an RSS feed), eg, a Wordpress blog; I have experience with this (History of Anthropologcy newsletter)<br><br>Maria: focus on topic-based updates might be better than focus on working group updates (to be more user-oriented) |
|     | Does the covid-era emphasis on virtual conferences (and lower or no registration and travel costs) make it easier to submit AITO-related proposals? | John | _We didn't have the time to cover this subject._ |
