|     | [Survey results](https://wiki.duraspace.org/download/attachments/176490993/AITOSurveyResults2.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1573698126076&api=v2), secondary analysis (table below)<br><br>*   70% manager/executive<br>*   80% assign ARKs<br>*   top vote getter (below): promotion |     |     |
|     | Possible outreach actions |     | PC: Valuable would be options to offer training on how to bring up ARKs in your institution. Anything from 30 mins to several hours.  <br>KE: Interactive or recorded webinar?  <br>PC: Both are valuable, along with a recruiting (less techy) webinar. Our devs would attend and raise questions about setting up their own resolver and how to use it.  <br>KE: Would a membership pitch be valuable that says "you get, eg, one hour, of free consultation with an expert"?  <br>PC: Yes, there should be a free webinar (recruiting). Also there's the idea of a trial membership, eg, like bitcurator did recently ($500 trial, normally several thousand a year)  <br>KE: Sounds like different levels of membership.  <br>MG: Datacite does one hour a month, called "open hours", with updates fromÂ datacite and from different members. They also send a monthly newsletter, with "top question of the month", new members who have joined, etc.  <br>BC: Sebastien's recorded Summit tutorial was very appreciated. BnF regularly and informally meets with individuals implementing ARKs and with vendors, who want conversations about ARK implementation. AITO could take on this kind of activity, possibly offered as a benefit of membership.  <br>BC: We also have trouble knowing where to point people to introduce the benefits (at very high level, for the lay person) of EZID and similar services.  <br>JK: What about extended training sessions, ala FSCI? What about training new trainers?  <br>MG: I've been to carpentries instructor training and to a day long FSCI. There's not a one size fits all. The assigning role is different from using or citing role, different from running a resolver role. I think there's a need for general id training, but would be careful about the audience and what the goal would be.  <br>PC: People who said they'd contribute effort could to become a trainer.JK: I think that's an excellent use of contributed effort. |
