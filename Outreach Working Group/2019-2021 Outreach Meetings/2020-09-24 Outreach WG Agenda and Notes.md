|     | Final sign-off (before translation work can begin) on new (English) shoulders documentation<br><br>*   [namespace section of ARKs FAQ](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/ARKs/ARK+Identifiers+FAQ#ARKIdentifiersFAQ-ARKnamespacesandsub-namespaces)<br>*   [ARK shoulders FAQ](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/ARKs/ARK+Shoulders+FAQ) |     | after several rounds of feedback, this work seems to have settled down<br><br>general agreement to declare it done and move on |
|     | Proposed: replace link to parallel gdoc version of FAQ with invitation to post comments to arks-forum. Why?<br><br>*   general public has only rarely used it<br>*   expensive parallel maintenance<br>*   similar functionality (to help maintainers of the French and Spanish versions) is offered by the wiki feature:  History → Compare versions |     | general agreement to replace link; unfortunately, no input yet from translator members |
|     | Proposed: graphic showing NAAN registry growth (promotional value?)<br><br>*   linked from [Who is using ARKs?](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/ARKs/ARK+Identifiers+FAQ#ARKIdentifiersFAQ-WhoisusingARKs?) section; auto-generated periodically from registry<br><br>![Numbers of ARK-assigning organizations since 2001.](https://n2t.net/e/images/naan_growth.png) |     | B: graph is fine for the FAQ<br><br>T: agreed, and it's simple enough to work at the small size<br><br>J: can see possible enhancements, eg, break down orgs by library, archive, for-profit, etc.<br><br>K: good enough to publish as is |
|     | Proposed wiki side bar edits:<br><br>*   move WG links up one level from below "working groups" umbrella (easier access to heavily used content)<br>*   move survey links (unused for some time) below top-level (where? Communications?)<br><br>Current side bar:<br><br>![](attachments/195166339/195166543.png) |     | M: fine with sidebar changes, but when the newly branded site is developed we should think about what shoulder surfaced<br><br>T: need clearer distinction between external and internal communication as we establish new site; the wiki should be more internally focused than the new site |
|     | Rebranding (ARKs Alliance – arks.org), unfinished business:<br><br>*   sidebar: move the  older AITO focused "Resources and Values Statement" to archive<br>*   who is willing to work on logo ideas? |     | T: agree to archiving the Resources and Values statement<br><br>T: logo generation services online might be useful, but might require an entire group conversation; there are some contractors out there that might help  <br>M: in the case of [ROR.org](http://ROR.org), we kind of just used the letters and added some triangles; one good thing is that logos can change as needed, so maybe we just need something functional for now; there are some free and openly licensed icons that you can search, eg, for "ark"<br><br>M: some icon sources: iconmonster, noun project |
|     | newsletter blog and mailchimp steps |     | P: Mailchimp account can be get started early, but no content until RSS feed; don't know if we can do WP free, but cheap should doable<br><br>P: [wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org) will need payment to use [arks.org](http://arks.org); [dreamhost.com](http://dreamhost.com) is what I have experience with and it's $2.59/month<br><br>P: recommend getting dreamhost account first, then role account for newletter plus config, then mailchimp role account |
