Working Group Documents
=======================

Created by John Kunze, last modified on May 20, 2024

ARKs-in-the-Open Working Groups share the following features.
-------------------------------------------------------------

*   Within its given scope, each WG is self-directed, renewing its objectives and deliverables every 12 months.
    
*   WG members are asked to seize opportunities to "grow" the community and broaden participation in it, at any and all levels, as appropriate.
    
*   Members are asked to communicate with other WGs and the Advisory Group regarding community evolution, technical developments, and collaboration possibilities that could help, or hurt, sustainability.
    
*   WG size is flexible, with 5-9 members being optimal. As necessary, any WG may spin off subgroups, eg, for a focused development effort.
    
*   WG members are asked to serve for 12 months, and may serve longer if they wish. To add a new person, a current member asks the WG to review a proposal describing what the new person expects to be able to contribute. WG meetings may have scheduled non-member guest appearances.
    
*   Each WG is free to decide how it will conduct internal communication (email, Slack channel, etc) and to set its own meeting schedule. Meetings are usually teleconferences.
    
*   Each WG is responsible for maintaining the WG wiki page, which should include schedules and links to agendas and meeting notes.
