|     | ARKs forum email, Feb 1<br><br>_Case of percent-encoded character_ |     | Greg to take on |
|     | ISSN-origin NAANs – ok to proceed if we issue this warning?<br><br>_There is a caveat. A NAAN assignment with provenance from an ISSN is considered to be a permanent association with a journal, and never an association with an ISSN. We understand that the ISSN for a journal does not change often, but the NAAN for a journal cannot be changed. Thus, the "s" in front of the NAAN only indicates origin, at a moment in time, of the NAAN. After the NAAN is associated with a journal, the NAAN registry has no connection whatsoever with future assignments of the original ISSN to other journals. This is a consequence of the ARK identifier's design to support permanence._ |     | John to ask larger group to review |
|     | [Networked Entity Model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QcmELCTnTWymmk8w8YNp1NHNaRk2NawYopJcytuNIZ8/edit) |     | Model to describe fundamentally distinct entity types covered by ARKs, so that the ?info spec can describe type-specific instructions.   <br>GJ: maybe new identifiers is a better way to go for dig/phys  <br>BC: where would you put ark for catalog record for document A vs ark for document A representation 1 vs ark for document A representation 2?  <br>KH: for Portico, hierarchical representation would be important, eg, article level is a slug |
