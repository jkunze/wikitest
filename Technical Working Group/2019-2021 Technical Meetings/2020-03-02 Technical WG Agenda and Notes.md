| Time | Item | Who | Notes |
|     | announcements |     | new NAAN Registry working group should take some pressure off this group<br><br>CNI to have a panel on AITO |
|     | intro to [version 2 of Networked Entity Model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kv3HEopw7PphZtHkOuf3gJVT1jKgNX8Um5rQ0lHVcek/edit) |     | GJ: how do we tell which resolver should deal with inflections  <br>TC: what is the purpose of this Nentity Model?  <br>JK: to clean up the mess and confusion of the diversity of networked objects that we all deal with  <br>TC: unique spelling may not work, using regular words might be better; it would help searchability if keywords appeared reliably and frequently as JSON keywords  <br>CM: consider more normal spellings and making new words upper case to make them stand out more  <br>GJ: I have trouble with the odd spellings  <br>CM: they're hard to remember  <br>KH: I also find spellings hard, but the new concepts could be helpful  <br>TC: this is quite relevant to what we do with phys/dig objects, and transcriptions; relations are probably covered in specs like linkrel  <br>MP: we should look into overlap with other initiatives, eg, OAI, IIIF, signposting, Portland common data model |
