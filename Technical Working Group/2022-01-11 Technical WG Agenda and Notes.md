| Calls for papers, submission deadlines, upcoming meetings: [Calendar of events](Calendar-of-events_208341505.html) |     | MP: Texas Conference on Digital Libraries - [https://www.tdl.org/tdl-events/tcdl/2022-tcdl/](https://www.tdl.org/tdl-events/tcdl/2022-tcdl/)  <br>MP: Had a request to be a part of a panel on PIDs and it might be a great chance to introduce the work of the ARK Alliance and also update on  <br>progress with different things.  MP is involved with this.  <br>JK: Are people still attending virtual conferences?  <br>GJ: I've stopped attending virtual conferences since I just end up working and trying to listen at the same time  <br>CM: why try to work and attend at the same time?  <br>GJ: seems like a good idea to try, but then its hard to avoid the flood of usual activity when it actually happens  <br>KH: my experience is similar; I just attend the panel I'm most interested in; I tried a virtual meeting room for socializing but it was a kind of disaster  <br>KH: there is an iPres (Glasgow) deadline in March |
| Any news items we should blog about? |     |     |
| new GH "arka" user, new [repo for spec](https://github.com/arks-org/arkspec)<br><br>freshly rebuilt with GH actions working for CI and draft submission/publication<br><br>process for contributions (KH)<br><br>passwords with keybase? |     | KH: some processes we follow for collaborative software editing that permits a review step before fulling accepting a change [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZXASVBocL7H3XjK4MyLfKZ3CTycVKJ4NnYpCy-RnEF4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZXASVBocL7H3XjK4MyLfKZ3CTycVKJ4NnYpCy-RnEF4/edit?usp=sharing)  <br>ACTION: note which of the many files is the one of interest (eg, just the main xml file  <br>JK: what kind of merge flavor should we use? merge commit, squash merge, or rebase merge?  <br>CM, GJ, AA: no opinion  <br>TC: we generally used to Merge Commit, but we also see rebase and merge  <br>TC, KH: don't do squash merge  <br>ACTION: document consensus on Merge Commit flavor  <br>JK: should we use Keybase to share passwords?  <br>TC: have you tried converting arka into an "organization"?  <br>AA: yes, good idea  <br>KH: here are some instructions [https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/converting-a-user-into-an-organization](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/converting-a-user-into-an-organization)  <br>ACTION: try setting this up  <br>TC: Here is a quick in-process list of practices we use that may help us here; it’s pretty terse:<br><br>Use proper local and remote branches.  <br>Keep your changes small  <br>Small changes that fail fast are easier to resolve.  <br>Focus on a Single Feature.  <br>Not to large of a PR.  Keep it under xxx lines.  <br>Take advantage of FS CD pipelines.  <br>Keep up to date  <br>Rebase, not merge, with origin master when it changes  <br>Use diffs when needed.  <br>Be aware of a squash.  <br>Pull requests should be short livedFollow coding practices that allow PRs to merge faster.  <br>Break your PR into small commits that tell a story.  <br>Do not wait to review existing PRs.<br><br>TC: in the end we might prefer rebase merge flavor of commit  <br>JK: probably not a big deal to change how we do it in the future |
| New [arkspec (32)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kunze-ark/32/)  <br>   [diffs v30->v32](https://www.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url1=draft-kunze-ark-30&url2=draft-kunze-ark-32)<br><br>via [GH-pages](https://arks-org.github.io/arkspec/) |     | JK: these are links to the newly generated specs and the github pages that are generated by CI (continuous integration) |
