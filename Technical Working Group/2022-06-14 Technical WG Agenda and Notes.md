| Announcements |     | jk: Mark Phillips saw a nice presentation from the "greens" folks at the Texas Digital Libraries conference  <br>bc: see greens entry at [https://coptr.digipres.org/index.php/Persistent\_Identification](https://coptr.digipres.org/index.php/Persistent_Identification) |
| Calls for papers, submission deadlines, upcoming meetings: [Calendar of events](Calendar-of-events_208341505.html) |     |     |
| Any news items we should blog about? |     |     |
| Preliminary discussion with about ARKs and NISO (National Information Standards Org): Karen Hanson, John Kunze, Jabin White, Nettie Lagace (NISO) |     | Seemed to go well |
| A few recent sample proposals are available at: <br><br>*   (Peer Review Taxonomy) [https://groups.niso.org/higherlogic/ws/public/download/25638/](https://groups.niso.org/higherlogic/ws/public/download/25638/)<br>*   (CRediT) [https://groups.niso.org/higherlogic/ws/public/download/22626/](https://groups.niso.org/higherlogic/ws/public/download/22626/)<br>*   (Journal Article Tag Suite) [https://groups.niso.org/higherlogic/ws/public/download/2577/](https://groups.niso.org/higherlogic/ws/public/download/2577/) — this one is from 2009 so it’s well before our “updated work item proposal form” was in use but it’s another example of something that was already existing/in use being made into an ANSI/NISO standard.<br><br>NISO Proposed Work Item Template<br><br>  <br>This document will help you to organize information about a proposed project and to get feedback  <br>from the NISO Topic Committee, NISO membership and the community. Project Proposers draft  <br>Work Items for approval by a Topic Committee and the NISO Voting Membership.  <br>Good practice is to prepare a draft and circulate to experts within and outside the NISO  <br>membership before submitting or asking for broad feedback. This allows you to improve the  <br>content and begin to build a constituency for the project. Work to keep the content to  <br>approximately one to two pages.  <br>The following sections should be included:  <br>**Work Item Title**:  <br>The title should include a verb that describes the kind of work that would be done and the  <br>deliverable or other objective, and any key contextual information. For example: Develop a  <br>Recommended Practice on the Application of RFID in US Libraries. In addition, a shorter, more  <br>easily identified working group name should be proposed at this stage (e.g., SUSHI).  <br>The following proposed work item is submitted by: Include names and affiliations (if  <br>available) for all proposers.  <br>**Background and Problem Statement:**  <br>Describe the current environment and issues or problems that this work item is intended to  <br>address. Please include related work that has been completed or that is underway and describe  <br>what is needed to complete or augment that work. While it is important to take a broad strategic  <br>view, please provide specific details or example of how the issue affects the constituencies that  <br>NISO serves. What are the risks to the community of not doing the project? Think of the  <br>audiences you are trying to reach through this work and what they care about.  <br>**Statement of Work:**  <br>Describe goals, objectives, and means. Remember that this is a starting point. Be specific as  <br>possible but don’t start the project! Please include:  <br> Project Goals: What are you trying to accomplish? Think of verbs like “improve” or “allow  <br>for”. Describe who will benefit and how. This builds from your problem statement.  <br>o What does the initiative need to do/provide/solve. AND, what does it NOT need  <br>to do/provide/solve  <br>o Who will benefit from the deliverables?  <br> Specific Deliverables and Objectives: Describe the concrete outcome(s) of the project.  <br>Expand on the deliverables in the title. Include any discrete tasks that must be  <br>accomplished as part of creating the deliverable. This might include conducting surveys,  <br>collecting examples of current practice, defining new practice.  <br>o How will the success of the work be measured or proved?  <br> Process: What approach do you foresee using: e.g., Appoint a Working Group (typical),  <br>Hold a Thought Leader Meeting, Engage Primary Editor and Response Panel, etc.  <br> Return on Investment: What benefits will accrue to adopters? It would be helpful if these  <br>can be described in relation to anticipated required development.  <br> Engagement Plan: How will the output of this project be  <br>circulated/advertised/communicated, particularly to stakeholders? How can uptake be  <br>encouraged?  <br>**Partners and Participation:**  <br>This is a crucial section of the Work Item Proposal. Describe other organizations—or organization  <br>subsets—that have a stake in the issue (or who would be expected to implement any solution),  <br>especially any that may bear development costs, and what role they will play in the work, if any.  <br>Are they already included in communication about this issue? Do they already support this  <br>project, and how? \[Including specific statements of support, participation and/or adoption is  <br>encouraged.\] Describe the type of people you need rather than specific people. Include a  <br>description of specific knowledge or skills, what organizational representation is required both  <br>from the perspective of the type of organization and role within organizations. Identify any  <br>expertise or skills that will need to come from outside NISO.  <br>**Timeline:**  <br>Provide target dates using Months from Project Approval for the stages of the work. Typically,  <br>NISO recommendations are published within 18 months of the formation of the working group  <br>(but shorter timetables are acceptable too, of course). An example timeline is shown below.  <br> Month 1: Appointment of working group  <br> Month 2: Approval and publication of charge and initial work plan (including final  <br>determination of scope)  <br> Months 3-9: Completion of information gathering (phase 1)  <br> Months 10-13: Completion of initial draft recommended practices document (phase 2)  <br> Months 14-16: Public comment period  <br> Month 18: Responses to comments and publication of final NISO Recommended  <br>Practice (target &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt;)<br><br>**Funding:**  <br>This may or may not be applicable, as most NISO projects are accomplished with industry  <br>volunteers meeting via conference call and asynchronous work. If applicable, identify any external  <br>sources of funding for the project. If you are seeking funding, please include this only for internal  <br>review. |     | rm: stakeholders seem to care more about presentation of value, rather than it having the stamp of an international org, so ANSI/NISO would be fine even though US-based.<br><br>jk: I've seen NISO standards becoming ISO standards w/o much friction<br><br>  <br><br>jk: question to answer - what's the track record for NISO standards becoming ISO standards?<br><br>[https://www.niso.org/niso-io/2017/11/niso-standards-are-free-read-use](https://www.niso.org/niso-io/2017/11/niso-standards-are-free-read-use)<br><br>  <br><br>all: ok to draft work item for review by WG (John and Karen) |
