| Item | Who | Notes |
| Announcements<br><br>*   union ARKA list pending members |     | PIDFest happening this week, Donny Winston presenting on ARKs in a Czech cultural heritage panel  <br>jk: Last week at Open Repositories Donny and I gave the ARK tutorial to 23 people  <br>gj: report on national pid strategy doesn't mention ARKs; aren't pids international?  <br>jk: union list has several pending members, but googlegroups can't seem to resend the invitations – maybe declare it "complete" for now? |
| Any news items we should blog about? Any calls for papers, submission deadlines, upcoming meetings we should note? Please add to [Calendar of events](Calendar-of-events_208341505.html). |     | gj: Force11 conference restarting |
| N2T/arks.org resolver status<br><br>*   open source? which license? |     | (passing along from Dave Vieglais, who sends regrets): I expect N2T to switch over to the new code next week |
| status of new process for updating documents on static website (arks.org) |     | no update |
| persistence statements subgroup strawman document |     | gj: link to sticky statements paper  <br>jk: ACTION will do  <br>gj: the focus should be on metadata fields; and probably switch to json syntax  <br>jk: I think of this ANVL thing as pseudo-code (pseudo-json)  <br>cm: greppable json appears to be GRON? |
