|     | [draft proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BtNA6RrIjF_Mlif1mlMlhYnRTeSRB1YdUn5AtDOmm_A/edit?ts=5e6286be) |     | SC: will have better luck with private foundations (Mellon, Sloan, etc) than with federal, playing on the idea that there are many kinds of data objects outside of the publication-centric view. Don't have Don Waters' successor in place, but Mellon emphasizing inclusiveness (eg, cheaper). Have been talking lots to open source people and everyone recommends involving the community early on rather than at the completion of the work.  <br>KE: this is one reason we're coming to this group; need to avoid design-by-committee  <br>JK: can lessen that effect by focussing on community requirements gathering  <br>KW: should seek input from other than the well-funded universities; Mellon and Sloan seem like good funders to approach  <br>SC: good to ask community to help you collect use cases  <br>KE: so the proposal might be strengthened if it talks about current use cases and inclusiveness of ARKs  <br>SC: Sloan is in process of changing its guidelines  <br>KW: Sloan and Mellon are less formal than NSF; often it starts with a one-page proposal  <br>KE: what about partners?  <br>SC: good idea to have 1-3 partners; I'd suggest making an open invitation  <br>KW: sometimes the funder has good ideas on partners  <br>KW: it is very important to include request to support 1-2 meetings (eg, planning to start, and another)  <br>KE: it is important to be transparent, with a project manager  <br>KW: most funders expect that the recipient will invest percentages of people to do things like project management  <br>KW: funders will want to know what the recipient is contributing, eg, time or storage  <br>KW: but don't understate what you need to complete the work |
