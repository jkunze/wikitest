|     | [upcoming meetings](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/ARKs/Calendar+of+events?src=contextnavpagetreemode), calls for papers, submission deadlines | JohnK | New page is in the outreach working group space - based on Fedora calendar. We can look at this regularly for opportunities for presentations. <br><br>OR 2021 ends today. JohnK spoke on a panel called "broken for all" about service providers/vendors not providing pid services and its impacts on aggregators. <br><br>Feel free to add events to the calendar. |
|     | grant proposal update | MarkP | Starting to float concept to various funders. Submitted preproposals (very short) to Mellon and Sloane and they are not taking us forward. Work doesn't align with their funding initiatives. Director at Sloane is focusing more on open science and may be a helpful framing for future proposals. Mellon working less on scholarly communications and more on cultural heritage and underrepresented collections. IMLS cycle is approaching. We may consider applying there in September.   <br>  <br>Kate - is there a history of IMLS funding for ARKS? <br><br>John - we don't believe they have. Mark has some experience with IMLS. <br><br>Mark - has a relationship with a program officer. National Leadership Grant track is possible - National Digital Platform. Pre-reading is helpful. National Science Foundation contact - data management section. Suggestions provided: Reaching out to NSF is fine but need to turn it into the project with research questions. Hard for them to support the development and maintenance of projects. They put a lot of infrastructure into the DOI world. <br><br>Erin - Thanks to Mark for all this hard work. |
|     | Wikipedia updates effective in feeding → google knowledge panel<br><br>*   what do you see when you search google for:  ark identifier | JohnK | Bertrand and JohnK working on Wikipedia page. Search results depend on user. But results have improved and would like to continue to improve it. |
|     | Independent NAAN curation – month 3 status<br><br>*   curation duty roster on [NAAN WG home page](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/ARKs/NAAN+Registry+Working+Group)<br>*   new NAAN form done<br>*   need to add "update NAAN" capability<br>*   promising work from a French archiving intern on automated map generation, plus categorization of institutions <br><br>\- Architecture<br><br>\- Archives<br><br>\- Association (only one)<br><br>\- Bank (only one)<br><br>\- Construction (only one)<br><br>\- Publication<br><br>\- Education : all organizations which have pedagogical content and which are not university<br><br>\- Governement agency<br><br>\- IT : organisations that offer services related to new technologies and software<br><br>\- Law (only one)<br><br>\- Library<br><br>\- Media : journalism, TV, press agencies ...<br><br>\- Museum<br><br>\- Music : only 3, maybe we can put it in others categories<br><br>\- Research : all institutes, laboratories and foundations that are not universities<br><br>\- University | JohnK | Making NAAN registry independent of CDL. Making progress via working group. Three more people have onboarded NAAN registry changes. The duty roster currently has 5 curators on it, creating redundancy in the community to backfill JohnK. <br><br>The "new NAAN" curation form will need to be adapted to handle the "update NAAN" case next. Kudos to Chloé for generating map and the classification by institutional type. Really nice work. <br><br>Frédérique says Chloé will end her work at the end of July. But her work is and will be very useful. It would be nice for there to be a conference presentation or advisory group presentation on this work. It could be interesting for stakeholders to learn more about it. |
|     | forming a nonprofit - issues<br><br>    financial consequences? taxes?  <br>    [n2t.net](http://n2t.net) as global ARK resolver infrastructure  <br>    purpose:   <br>     - own the [arks.org](http://arks.org) and n2t.net domains  <br>     - own the ARK trademark  <br>     - do an MOU or contract  <br>     - receive grant funding | JohnK | We have talked about this and put it on hold along with the work of the sustainability working group. Can an organization exist that costs very little and would let us pay for domains and own trademark. We could enter into an MOU or contract. Could that be with CDL? Other? We would like to be able to receive grant funding. How complicated is it? What are the implications from an administration standpoint? The technical working group has spoken about the n2t infrastructure as a component. <br><br>MarkP - IIPC is a consortium and has struggled with not being able to sign contracts and take risks. It was international and staff were dispersed. We have CLIR as a fiscal sponsor. They handle the bank account, services for reporting and financial auditing, paying bills, charging membership fees and can own the domains. We can sign contracts via CLIR if needed. The question of registering as an entity is still out there.  But the fiscal sponsor works fine. If they did register as a legal entity there would be debate about where to register since it's international. It may not be as hard for ARKS. There is a formal relationship. IIIF initiative is in the same type of relationship with CLIR. <br><br>Erin - LYR is fiscal sponsor for DSpace, Fedora, and VIVO, PASIG, others. There are some implications and costs associated with forming a non-profit. I wouldn't take that lightly. I have seen and heard about a bunch of different models for fiscal sponsorship that address the needs of the group. Fiscal sponsors provide insurance, taxes/reporting, <br><br>Brian - There was a presentation at OR by Heather Greer Klien and Rosalyn Metz, Emory University/Samvera just moved from LYRASIS to OASIS as fiscal sponsor and presented on their process. <br><br>Mark P - fees can be a percentage of annual income. There are a number of organizations that can fulfill these types of roles. CLIR, CRL, and a few others. <br><br>Erin - find out how much this costs and decide if it's worth trying to raise the money. <br><br>Kate - list what we're trying to solve. What would we give up to pursue this? <br><br>JohnK - we are putting the fiscal sponsorship and registering on the table. We want ARK Alliance to be independent of CDL. Right now CDL owns our domains. That could be their contribution. The organizations that provide fiscal sponsorship - are they set up to do it? <br><br>Erin - CDL is the org home right now. I would ask ourselves, is that home holding the program back? raising money is hard and it may come at a cost of having fewer people serving on working groups. <br><br>Kurt - it isn't a problem to have a home at CDL. But we do want the community to develop a sense of ownership and that is happening in a few ways. Some of what CDL owns is portable. |
