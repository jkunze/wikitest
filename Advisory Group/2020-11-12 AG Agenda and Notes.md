| Time | Item | Who | Notes |
|     | announcements<br><br>*   December meeting cancelled? |     | At least 3 ARK-related talks coming up at CNI and PIDapalooza.<br><br>Agreed to cancel December meeting. |
|     | brief review of draft brochure site with new brand and logo<br><br>*   ok to move forward?<br>*   rollout when? January? |     | JK: review of draft arks.org site  <br>\- home page, new name, logo  <br>\- goal of migrating select content from [n2t.net](http://n2t.net) and lyrasis wiki  <br>\- work in progress – please comment  <br>MP: looks good  <br>KW: agreed; would be good to add a couple sentences to the current one-sentence comparison between DOIs and ARKs  <br>KE: there could be a link out to where this is address in the FAQ  <br>RF: figuring that out will take time, but generally better for links not to leave the site  <br>All: ok to move forward  <br>All: ok  with rollout early next year |
|     | funding status<br><br>*   leading partner + CDL<br>*   looking for a 3rd partner<br>*   Other forms to express community support |     | JK: huge thanks to Mark for agreeing to act as leading partner on the grant  <br>KW: we should remember that the more partners on a grant, the more complex the admin gets; if community buy-in is the goal, a show of that can be achieved with letters of support and/or an advisory board (AB)  <br>KE: yes, we are open to any way that signals to funders that there's community support  <br>KW: might be strategic to have other letters of support (say 3) from outside AITO  <br>KW: funders sometimes want to know that you're in a collaborative rather than competitive situation with like-minded orgs, hence support letter (whether from within AITO or outside it)  <br>RF: a letter from Lyrasis and the network behind it could be very important  <br>KW: the detailed proposal should specify individuals who have committed (if proposal is funded) to serve on the AB; their having specific skills related to the project should be attractive to funders  <br>BM: being on the AB is a much easier ask of institutions than being a partner  <br>RF: haven't had a chance yet to check with SI on the partner question  <br>KW: sometimes an AB role rather than a partner role eliminates conflict of interest problems  <br>MP: there's usually flexibility, depending on amount of money and funding source; we have lots of experience leading "in name" with money flowing through UNT  <br>KE: we've been focussing on a number of funders, with IMLS in front; plan to submit to various funders at the same time  <br>KW: if you get a positive response from one, it's good to notify the other funder, who can then make adjustments |
