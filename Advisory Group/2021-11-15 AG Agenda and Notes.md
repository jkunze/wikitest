| Continue discussion of Sustainability Issues raised in October meeting |     | The October meeting also included a presentation by Kurt Ewoldsen and John Chodacki  about some strategic questions we would like the group to discuss and work on together ([slides attached](attachments/225150989/225150992.pdf)).  The conversation after our presentation was very thought-provoking and we touched on:<br><br>*   How can the ARK Alliance build a more sustainable structure that doesn’t rely so heavily on single people or single organization?<br>*   What role does this advisory group have in the governance of the wider ARK community?<br>*   How can we fine-tune our AG processes and the processes of the other working groups to ensure multiple people/orgs are involved in sustaining our initiative?<br>*   CDL continues to be committed to the ARK community.  However, the resourcing commitments can not continue at previous levels.<br>*   Overall, how can we ensure that our structures are right-sized and resourced to sustain the community?<br><br>The discussion seemed very timely and important so attendees determined it was best to not wait until December to meet again…so I was tasked with organizing this ARKA AG meeting in November.<br><br>\[Today's Discussion\]<br><br>Review of last meeting<br><br>Erin:  this is a good time to assess where the organization is at this time and where it wants to go.  LYRASIS did an evaluation a few years ago that could be referenced.<br><br>Bertrand:  The french-speaking subgroup of ARKA can talk about how to do more as a subgroup.<br><br>Martin:  A more formal charge to the AG could be useful in creating more engagement and activity.<br><br>Ricc:  Could/should move towards a structure that would allow delegation of responsibilities from CDL staff to others.  Can we call ARK adopters to step forward and take more ownership?  If CDL is the main voice at conferences, etc. then the community is missing an opportunity to showcase their individual work.<br><br>Martin:  Good idea to evaluate where the organization is at and re-think activities to make sure that we are meeting our needs.<br><br>Kate:  Sustainability planning can come down to very practical things:  create a detailed list of every cost, identify what costs are not being covered and talk about how to deal with the gaps.  Need exact information before undertaking a problem-solving exercise to address the issues.<br><br>John Chodacki:  ARK is a community of practice and has a low barrier of entry.  You can get your NAAN and roll your own (trust in your own sustainability) or look for services or support from the community (scarce coverage).  What is it that the ARKA provides?<br><br>Ricc:  Leaning on CDL staff.  Looking at the spec and determining the best way to implement ARKs; technical assistance and support.<br><br>Martin:  Could promote ARK use in aggregate to show the value of identifier; impact the ARKs can have with specific outcomes.  Could showcase specific use-cases for the identifier.<br><br>Kate:  Not really sure.  Portico is very independent from a technical standpoint.  What is the goal or what is the problem the ARKA is trying to solve?<br><br>Mark:  Working to bring the notion of sustainability to the initiative in the long-term.  Work has been centered at CDL for so long that there is fragility in the environment.  Allows you to support a decision to move forward with ARKs; has more of an "official" status and presence now; provides stability.  Working groups ensure that many are involved and allow opportunities for many to be involved; creates a stronger community.<br><br>Bertrand:  Most things have been covered; showcasing sustainability ensures trust in the ARKA infrastructure.  Guidance in understanding that access persistence to your own material is the most important; how do you consider your objects and how do you name them.<br><br>Erin:  having a canonical source of information; living document like the FAQs that were created are very important support for making the decision to move forward with ARKs.<br><br>John Cho |
