| Item | Who | Notes |
| Continue Sustainability Discussion - Round Robin on any new thoughts about previous discussions | All Attendees | ARKA needs groups (beyond CDL) to step into leadership roles to ensure our long-term sustainability.<br><br>Ricc:  Seems like the Sustainability WG left things at a point and we are back to where that stopped.  CDL has committed to technical infrastructure.<br><br>Erin:  Engagement issues right now because of external pressures, so maybe we can frame changes in operations as a temporary stoppage or pulling back.  Temporary pause on Outreach? |
| Nominations.  In an effort to share roles and responsibilities, the AG needs two volunteers to step forward for Chair and Vice Chair. |     | Two roles that need to be filled immediately:<br><br>*   Chair: Lead the the ARKA AG for one year (2022)<br>*   Vice Chair: Partner with Chair during 2022 and agree to be Chair in 2023<br><br>JChodacki:  CDL leading most of the groups and setting the agendas for discussion; first action we are proposing is that the AG leadership model change and someone outside of CDL takes on these responsibilities, so that the AG is more representative of the community.<br><br>Ricc:  Thumbs up<br><br>Erin:  Thumbs up<br><br>Mark:  Leadership picture was fuzzy up to now; having a new process makes sense.<br><br>Kate:  What is the role of the AG?  Whose work is the AG reviewing/advising?<br><br>JChodacki:  That is a good question and needs to be answered by the group as a whole.<br><br>Erin:  Original goal was to transition governance of ARKA from CDL to the community.  Oversee working groups and ensure sustainability of the ARKA.  John & Kurt were never intended to be permanent leaders of the AG.  You want members to cycle through the AG and grow the representation of ARKA within the community.<br><br>Kate:  As an AG, what do we do if things get messed up?  Who is accountable for the performance of the ARKA groups and what are our options for addressing that?<br><br>Erin:  Normal to struggle with concept of accountability in a distributed group like ARKA.<br><br>Ricc:  How would we correct course in a working group?<br><br>Kurt:  There was an original concept that the AG would be more directive and involved in the working group operation.<br><br>Ricc:  No problem going back to the original structural concept; having CDL step in won't help in the long term.  Some AG members are already represented in the WGs and we should discuss why that isn't working.<br><br>Kate:  The role of advising versus participating is very different; this could require a larger AG and a different set of skills.<br><br>JChodacki:  Liaison structure requires more people?  Putting too much on too few people also isn't sustainable.  So back to the chair question?<br><br>Erin:  Maybe just a vice chair to start with that goes through a mentoring period?<br><br>Mark:  Starting with the vice chair seems reasonable.  Lets poll the group by e-mail asking for a vice chair volunteer.  (all agreed)<br><br>Kurt:  We want more participation in the discussion outside of the meetings, via e-mail or??<br><br>Ricc:  Can we edit the agenda on the wiki?<br><br>JChodacki & Kurt:  Yes, and we will make sure you all have permissions.<br><br>Kurt:  Should we go back to monthly meetings?  Yes (no objections)<br><br>JChodacki:  We will be having two different types of discussions next, depending on whether someone volunteers to be the vice chair or not.<br><br>Kurt:  Please let us know if we are not making enough space for other voices? |
| Process discussion on how to evaluate other ARKA structures against the criteria of how to ensure they are multi-stakeholder and sustainable |     | Discussion of the leadership and sustainability of all ARKA groups, as well as how ARKA will oversee these groups going forward:<br><br>*   Advisory Group<br>*   Outreach<br>*   Technical<br>*   NAAN Registry |
