| Introducing new AG member from CDL: John Chodacki |     | John Chodacki is now a member of the Advisory Group. (intro slides here) |
| Sustainability issues |     | The start of a discussion about the large dependence of many ARKA activities on a single organization and individual (CDL & John Kunze).  This is not sustainable and for the ARKA to be a viable organization in the long term, this situation needs to be addressed.<br><br>The conversation after our presentation was very thought-provoking and we touched on:<br><br>*   How can the ARK Alliance build a more sustainable structure that doesn’t rely so heavily on single people or single organization?<br>*   What role does this advisory group have in the governance of the wider ARK community?<br>*   How can we fine-tune our AG processes and the processes of the other working groups to ensure multiple people/orgs are involved in sustaining our initiative?<br>*   Overall, how can we ensure that our structures are right-sized and resourced to sustain the community?<br><br>The discussion seemed very timely and important so attendees determined it was best to not wait until December to meet again. |
