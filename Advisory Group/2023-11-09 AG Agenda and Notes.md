| Item | Who | Notes |
| Announcements |     | jc: as part of upgrading CDL infrastructure, a cutover was made yesterday ARK resolution is going through [arks.org](http://arks.org) and ARK static pages are no longer going through the Dreamhost Wordpress site; it's now ok to shut down the Dreamhost account; CDL is still working on a newly refactored N2T code  <br>jk: we knew this was in the works, but it would have been nice to have advance notice with the precise time and date for such a major transition that affects all ARK resolution globally  <br>mp: i didn't know if it would be this week or in January, would be better to have advance notice  <br>jc: sounds great; the next major transition will be Nov 27 (newly refactored N2T); will coordinate with Maria on Outreach WG for mechanics on the changes  <br>mp: it is also undefined how changes to github get into the server at CDL/AWS; we need to understand this so that the ARKA can resume document maintenance  <br>jk: yes, over a dozen people had edit access to the Wordpress content, but no member of an ARKA working group currently knows how to make edits |
| Any news items we should blog about? Any calls for papers, submission deadlines, upcoming meetings we should note? Please add to [Calendar of events](Calendar-of-events_208341505.html). |     |     |
| Updates from Groups:<br><br>*   TechnicalÂ <br>*   NAAN<br>*   Outreach |     | Technical WG: original member Tom Creighton from FamilySearch has retired, Rob Lyon will be asked to replace him; activity to identify and add missing ARK properties in wikidata; on-boarding newer people; ARK spec renewed last week<br><br>Outreach WG: 3 tutorials and 1 i-school class presentation of ARK introduction; blog template created for drawing out elements of a simple blog post for an institution, to be piloted with a subgroup and the Frick collection; lots of interest in the Frick's arklet implementation (with shoulders and inflections and different metadata formats); ARKA youtube channel is getting some playlist curation (John Jung)<br><br>NAAN WG: 35 new orgs since Sept 1; cleaned up group protocol for dealing with old tickets; a few edge cases dealt with |
| Hosting platforms for ARK Alliance Documentation | (Phillips) | Options for moving off the Lyrasis wiki<br><br>jc: googledocs seems ok  <br>jk: don't think we have big requirements for lyrasis move; would like to keep maintenance burden low  <br>jb: agree about low maintenance; google account may be good enough; not worth spending much time on; fine if you want to use IA's google workspace account  <br>jk: would it be ok to move 4 WG home pages to [arks.org](http://arks.org), as well as the FAQs (4 docs), conference calendar (leaving it to WGs to figure out how to handle meeting notes/agendas)?  <br>mp: ok by me  <br>mp: jc can you ask Lyrasis if we can stay on wiki until Dec 31? I can volunteer William Hicks to connect with jk and Outreach group |
| Next Steps for Advisory Group Discussion | (Phillips) | mp: what about sustainability, funding, org models, what does the AG want to do going forward? what about new AG members, new time schedule?  <br>mp: I'll push this discussion to the January meeting; i'm on sabbatical in Santa Fe until Thanksgiving  <br>jk: for January, I'd be interested in generating ideas for what we can do with offers of help (eg, the recent Dutch offer of staff and servers) |
