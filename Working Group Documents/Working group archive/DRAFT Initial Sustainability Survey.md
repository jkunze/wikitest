_Note: a cover letter can explain some background and point to the FAQ._ 

The ARKs-in-the-Open (AITO) project would like to ask current and potential ARK users for input on how we should target our initial efforts and how they might be supported. From previous feedback, we identified a number of possibilities below. Please rank these in priority order (1=highest) from your perspective, and indicate whether you or others in your organization would be willing to contribute time and effort.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Priority Ranking | Activity Description | Would you participate? |
|     | Open source development of ARK resolver software (next generation of NOID & N2T). |     |
|     | Open source development project for an ARK management application (similar to ezid.cdlib.org) that uses N2T. |     |
|     | Effort to promote ARK understanding and usage. |     |
|     | Effort to catalog the kinds of things ARKs are being used to identify. |     |
|     | Running a consortial ARK resolver and/or management service for ARK community members. |     |

_… to better understand what ARK users (current and potential) value and what they would contribute to sustain and develop that value._
