Draft ARK ToC for Wikipedia
===========================

Created by John Kunze on Aug 22, 2019

**Challenges**

1.  I needed a clear delineation of what each public communication point is and what is unique about its purpose. That tells me what should/should not go in the Wikipedia article. 
2.  I couldn’t really draft the ToC without also kind of drafting the content in my mind’s eye. So this document suggests what actually goes under those headings.

**Opening paragraphs**

Wikipedia articles start with an opening paragraph that is above the table of contents.  The ARK opening paragraph should:

*   Succinctly define what ARKs are, with appropriate links to related Wikipedia entries, such as "Persistent identifier".
*   Like the DOI opener, it should clearly convey the most common user communities, i.e. cultural heritage institutions such as libraries and museums.
*   Should touch on the role of resolver service

**Proposed Wikipedia ToC**

*   ARK Features
*   Structure and syntax
*   Resolvers and other tools
*   Comparison with other identifier schemes
*   History and administration
*   See also
*   Notes and references
*   External links

**ARK Features**

*   Start with the features that may not be unique to ARKs, but are core features – persistence.
*   Flexibility – extend a ARK for a complex digital object to be able to uniquely identify any component of that object.
*   Lifecycle – create/reserve ARKs early in the digital object creation workflow

**Structure and syntax**

*   Perhaps include the illustration from the FAQ.
*   It would be nice if NAAN could be a Wikipedia article of its own. Barring that, try to get a 1 to 2 sentence definition of the role of NAAN.

**Resolvers and other tools**

*   Use this section to elaborate on the role of resolver services and related open source tools as well as services like EZID.

**Comparison with other identifier schemes**

*   This can be brief. Some differentiating features will already have been mentioned above. I do think it’s important for the article to show awareness of the sector, and to connect users to other systems.

**History and administration**

*   Role of CDL, N2T in development
*   Information about the scope of adoption (without a long list of adopters).
*   Current administration - AITO, IETF

**Additional notes**

I saw Wikipedia as being for a general audience, who might not know much about identifiers and who may not be in the process of implementing ARKs.  I did not include a heading that was focused on ‘how-to’ for adopters – that seemed more like a role for the ARK page at N2T or the FAQ.

I’m including a spreadsheet that

*   Lists ToC headings for related/similar documents
*   Tries to distinguish the audience and purpose of the three main communication points. I know we’ve discussed this in our meetings, but I didn’t investigate to see if we wrote it down.
