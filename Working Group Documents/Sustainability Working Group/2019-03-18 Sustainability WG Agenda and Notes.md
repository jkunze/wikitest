| 25m | *   Presentation of current ARK infrastructure costs at CDL<br>    *   ARK infrastructure timeline<br>    *   ARKs @ CDL Architecture<br>    *   ARKs @ CDL cost estimates<br>    *   AITO phase 1 goals | Kurt, John | *   The call is being recorded. |
| 35m | Questions and discussion | All | KE: Majority of EZID dev/UI costs due to DOI usage  <br>RS: Can we split out ARK from DOI costs?  <br>KW: What's the minimum required cost to keep the lights on?  <br>RS: What's CDL's commitment to DOIs?  <br>RS: Is EZID the AITO responsibility?  <br>JK: No<br><br>RS: is $70K the minimum needed?  <br>KE: yes, however, there's more needed in terms of community, eg, if someone  <br>gave us that money, it would still be a CDL project, that requires CDL to  <br>keep running it.  <br>RS: why isn't it just a question of revenue?  <br>JK: we need help understanding who/what org gets paid the $70K to continue  <br>ARK infrastructure  <br>KE: agreed; how can we come up with $300K / year for phase1 goals and also next gen resolver?  <br>KW: is there a need that we're responding to? if not, are we willing to keep it going regardless of need?  <br>Is there a customer base to keep this going?  <br>KE: I think the latter. We are in uncharted waters. What does it mean to see  <br>all the expressions of interest we've seen  <br>KW: what if we break down all the costs, divided the total by the number of people in the community, and ask if they would be willing to pay that amount  <br>KE: yes, there are people paying vendors, some running their own infrastructure  <br>RS: sounds very service oriented, like Crossref  <br>KE: John and I will try to refine language around the value proposition  <br>KW: can we talk about the minimum viable product  <br>JK: maybe a Crossref-type org is the right model |
