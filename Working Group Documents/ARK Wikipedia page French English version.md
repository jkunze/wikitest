============================================

Created by SÃ©bastien Peyrard, last modified on Jul 30, 2019

Rough comparison
================

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **English version** | **French version** |
| Presentation (persistance, inflections, persistence = a matter of service, resolution tools : Noid, EZID) | Presentation (persistence, list of what ARKs can identify, qualifier part) |
| Structure (NAAN, NMAH, qualifier) | Structure :  <br>URL / name ARK (error : the name ARK is considered a URL in the article)  <br>1 identifier, 1..\* NMAH  <br>Commented example (actionable / non actionable part)  <br>NMA (make the identifier actionable)  <br>NAAN |
| List of sample NAANs + presentation of the NAAN registry | Use of ARKs  <br>\- List of NAANs  <br>\- Use by the BnF  <br>\- Use by the CDL |
| Generic services :  <br>Access services (what it does)  <br>Policy service (what it does)  <br>Description service (what it does) | Missing |

First analysis
==============

The French version is not a translation of the English one. Each version has been conceived independently from the other. The English version is better, it should be the basis for evolution ; then the French version could be translated from the English one.

As mentioned during last meeting, a list of NAANs is unnecessary. A link to the NAAN registry is enough

Corrections of errors in the French version (the ARK id is not a URL but can be (and is in a majority of cases) embedded in a URL ; neither is it a URI even though it is based on the URI syntax  
Additions in the english version: add the distinction between the ARK name and the URL that can embed it.

Target structure for the article
================================

*   Presentation (could be kept as is)
*   History of ARKs
*   Governance of ARKs (CDL, AITO group, open nature of ARKs, open forum)
*   Generic services (before the structure)
*   Structure (URL vs ARK, anatomy of the ARK : scheme/NAAN/name). Proposal : illustrate with examples
*   Use of ARKs : proposal : areas of use with the map of NAANs ; center of gravity of ARKs = memory institutions (but not limited to them

With open questions :

*   Should we add a section "relationship with other identifiers"? I think it might prove a time-consuming task which might lead to endless discussions on Wikipedia; we could be considered biassed as the ARK outreach group. In any case we can only state facts
*   Should we add a "Tools" section? It might be better to point to an external list of tools (as for NAANs)
